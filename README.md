# Real-time-Beat-Tracking-and-Generative-3D-Visualization-System
A real-time computational demonstration of algorithmic control over visual outputs in Max/MSP. 

Key Features: Algorithmic Structure, Real-time Visualization, HCI

This Max/MSP project is a real-time computational demonstration of algorithmic control over visual outputs. The system's core function is beat-tracking via logical operations on the input audio signal, using the derived rhythmic data as the primary control parameter for a generative 3D environment (Jitter/OpenGL).

The design principle focuses on controlled stochasticity. 

The 3D space contains two distinct visual elements: geometrically precise forms (representing order/logic) and non-uniform rational B-splines (NURBS) that exhibit randomized, yet rhythmically driven, morphing behavior. This explores algorithmic parameterization where the underlying logic is rigorous, but the immediate visual output maintains a high degree of predictable unpredictability.

# Real-time-Beat-Tracking-and-Generative-3D-Visualization-System
## Description
A real-time audiovisual system developed in Max/MSP that explores how rhythmic structures extracted from audio can be translated into dynamic, spatial visual behaviors. The project combines rule-based beat tracking with generative 3D graphics to examine the relationship between algorithmic control, perceptual rhythm, and visual expressivity.

## Concept & Motivation
Rather than treating beat tracking as a purely analytical task, this project approaches rhythm as an active, shaping force within a constrained system. Rhythmic events are used not only to trigger visuals, but to continuously modulate form, density, motion, and emergence in a 3D environment. This allows rhythm to behave as a driving agency rather than a static time grid.

## System Design
The system performs beat and event detection through logical operations. By filtering audio signals, it produces rhythmic control data that drives a generative 3D scene (Jitter/OpenGL). Two contrasting visual structures are employed:
- Geometric wireframe forms, representing stability, order, and algorithmic structure
- NURBS-based surfaces, representing fluidity, uncertainty, and continuous transformation

Low-frequency rhythmic events trigger large-scale morphing behaviors, while mid-to-high frequency events modulate density, deformation, and line-based structures. Controlled stochasticity is introduced to ensure the variability and unpredictability of the immediate visual outcome, though the underlying logic remains deterministic.

## Artistic Perspective
By placing an organic, rhythm-driven form within a rigid geometric frame, the project explores the tension between **freedom and constraint** in an algorithm-mediated system. The visuals oscillate between confinement and release, suggesting how rhythmic expression persists even when subjected to strict computational structures.

## Author’s Note
This project represents an early exploration of rhythm as a perceptual and embodied phenomenon rather than a purely temporal metric. It directly informed my later research focus on rhythmic structure, beat salience, and predictability in music technology and therapeutic contexts.
The textures applied to the NURBS surfaces are based on abstract paintings created by a close friend and visual artist. Their gestural and non-figurative nature complements the project’s focus on rhythm-driven transformation, providing visual material that emphasizes movement, density, and variation over literal representation.
